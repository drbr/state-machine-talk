# Reducers and State Machines in Local UI

This repo contains the code examples for a talk I gave in February 2021.

## Codesandbox

These code samples are meant to be viewed in codesandbox.io. Enable "Current Module View" and open individual files from the `examples` directory.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

All the usual scripts are available, including:

- `yarn start`
- `yarn test`
- `yarn build`
- `yarn eject`
