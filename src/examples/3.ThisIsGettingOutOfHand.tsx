        There's a lot of state to keep track of, and it's starting to resemble
        spaghetti code. üçù

          "Business logic" of state updates is scattered throughout the
          component

        <li>
          If we're not careful, we could end up in an invalid combination (e.g.{' '}
          <Mono>!isEditing && isBusySaving</Mono>, or using{' '}
          <Mono>editorValue</Mono> in readonly mode)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> If multiple pieces of state depend on
        each other, or if multiple values get updated at the same time, manage
        that state as one.
