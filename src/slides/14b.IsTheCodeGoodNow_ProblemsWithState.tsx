        Actions and side effects are in good shape, but we still have a problem
        with state.

          What happens if we're viewing the readonly display and we get a{' '}
          <Mono>START_SAVE</Mono> action?

      <p>
        We've been talking about <em>readonly mode</em> and <em>edit mode</em>â€¦
        can we structure the code to reflect these concepts?
