      <h1>The Reducer Pattern</h1>
      <p>
        A reducer is a pure function that implements this
        formula:
      </p>
      <p>
        <Mono>
          {'(previousState, action) => nextState'}
        </Mono>
      </p>
      <p>What is a "pure function"?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Has no dependencies and{' '}
          <em>doesn't manipulate any state</em>, it just
          provides information.
        </li>
        <li>
          Instead of mutating <Mono>previousState</Mono>{' '}
          directly, returns a new object representing{' '}
          <Mono>nextState</Mono>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Since it's just a function that deals with plain
          JS objects, a reducer can be used with any UI
          framework!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <VerticalSpacer />
      <ul>
        <EmojiListItem.Person>
          "O, wise reducer, hypothetically … if the current
          state were 2, what would the state be after an
          'add 1' action?"
        </EmojiListItem.Person>
        <EmojiListItem.Owl>
          "I don't know who you are or why you're asking,
          but … 3." 🍭
        </EmojiListItem.Owl>
      </ul>
      <VerticalSpacer />
      <h2>
        A reducer manages all interrelated pieces of state
        as a single object.
      </h2>
      <p>
        All state that's part of the same system should be
        managed by the same reducer.
