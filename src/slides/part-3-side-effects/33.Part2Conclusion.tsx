        This formula is capable of describing almost any stateful logic in a
        pure, self-contained way!
      </p>
      <p>Recap:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>State</strong> is persisted in the system
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Actions</strong> happen from the outside and affect the system
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Effects</strong> are emitted from the system and affect the
          outside
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A reducer can contain all the logic that co√∂rdinates state, actions and
        effects; it gets interpreted by a runtime framework to persist state and
        execute effects.
      </p>
